``` bash
  .....................................

  9 scenarios (9 passed)
  37 steps (37 passed)
```

## Aims
To get a better understanding of:
 1. Cucumber.js
 2. Behaviour Driven Development (BDD)
 3. How to implement your own scenario (Stage 3)

## BDD and Cucumber.js Overview
By no means is this meant to be an exhaustive tutorial on BDD. But basically, the hint is in the name...

BDD is about testing the *behaviour* of the system. Well, first agreeing and specifying the behaviour, and then testing the system's conformance to this desired behaviour. The idea is that these specifications are things that can be generated with, and understood by, the key stakeholders in the system. Not just developers, but other humans as well. It was borne out of Test Driven Development (TDD), and conceptually it's specifying the system with, and testing the system against, a higher level specification.

Basically you specify the behaviour of the system as some nice natual(ish) language specifications. These are called stories (or features in cucumber.js, and I'll call them features here). The features are composed of scenarios. Scenarios are composed of [potentially reusable] steps. And we write glue from these steps to drive our system code and test it.

At least that's how I think about it. If you look at a [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) you'll read something like this:
> BDD is a second-generation, outside-in, pull-based, multiple-stakeholder, multiple-scale, high-automation, agile methodology. It describes a cycle of interactions with well-defined outputs, resulting in the delivery of working, tested software that matters.

## Tutorial
The tutorial is split into three stages. Each builds on the former and adds more complexity (to the tests and to the system). However, at all stages we are working with the same directory structure:
```
cucumber-slice-by-slice/
|- features/             # cucumber.js *.feature files (gherkin syntax)
   |- support/           # cucumber.js World definition + step definitions
|- models/               # the code for the "calculator system". The actual system code to be tested
|- app.js                # ordinarily the main file for a Node.js project (unused in TuteCumber)
|- README.md             # you're staring at it
```
Thanks to the alphabetical gods (i.e. blind luck) the order of files here is the order in which we'd introduce them:
 * first, in cucumber.js, features are written using [gherkin syntax](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin) (very free flowing natural language)
 * then, the features are broken down into steps, which are defined in the step definitions
 * then, the steps reference a World object which is the context which drives the...
 * actual code to be tested (the models here)

**Note**: cucumber.js automatically looks in, and expects content to be inside a `features/` directory, so you don't actually have to configure anything, just use this structure.

### Our System (Calculator)
As much as I hate trivial examples, the "system" that this tute uses is a *simple* calculator - *stupidly simple* actually; think addition and subtraction only. But it does provide enough "meat" to see how BDD can be used to evolve your system, and how the addition of new features in Cucumber drives this process.

### First feature: Addition (aka Stage 1)
Now, the first stage of the system sees us defining our first feature - addition. Calculators should let us add numbers. But first, let's update our code to the relevant release / commit:
``` bash
  $ git checkout Stage1
  $ npm test
```
The last command runs the tests again and this time we should be testing a smaller number of scenarios (indicating the code has been "reverted" back to the first stage where we only had a smaller number of tests defined). You should see something like:
``` bash
  ......

  2 scenarios (2 passed)
  6 steps (6 passed)
```
#### Features
The first file to look at is the [`features/Feature1.feature`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage1/features/Feature1.feature) file (later I renamed this to `addition.feature`, but at this point I had it unimaginatively named). You can see that we have some basic scenarios here for this feature. The scenarios follow a *given-when-then* template:
 * Given: initial context or preconditions
 * When: events that occur
 * Then: expected outcomes

You'll see that at this stage, the addition feature just defines 2 simple (and obvious) scenarios.

#### Step Definitions
Now we want to define the steps. Our steps are in [`features/support/steps.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage1/features/support/steps.js). However, if we had only written the .feature file, and nothing else, when we tried to run the tests we'd see something like this (you can test this out by clearing out the step definitions file and running the `npm test`):
``` bash
UUUUUU

2 scenarios (2 undefined)
6 steps (6 undefined)

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

Given("the calculator is clear", function(callback) {
  // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
  callback.pending();
});

When("I add {int} and {int}", function(arg1, arg2, callback) {
  // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
  callback.pending();
});

Then("the result should be {int}", function(arg1, callback) {
  // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
  callback.pending();
});
```
What this is telling us is that although we've defined the feature, there's no step definitions (yet!). Helpfully cucumber.js gives us the templates for these step definitions (in JavaScript).

In essence, this file is where we have the `Given/When/Then` definitions. Inside these definitions, we call methods on the World object (e.g. `this.clearCalculator()` or `thissetArguments(arg1, arg2)`). In particular, in the `Then` definition, we perform a test.


#### World
According to the [cucumber.js website](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), the World object is:
> *World* is a class destined to be used in step definitions

Basically, inside our World definition, ([`features/support/world.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage1/features/support/world.js)), we (finally?) reference our actual code to be tested. In this case our calculator (`Calc`) object (more on this below). We call methods on our calculator, like `this.calc.clearCalculator()` and `this.calc.add()` from those "utility properties" mentioned above.
#### Calculator Model
Finally, you can see the definition of our actual "system code", the definition of our Calculator class. This is defined in the [`models/calc.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage1/models/calc.js) file. All we do is store the arguments when they are set, and use them when we want to add.
#### Stage 1 Comments
We can see that at this stage, the [`models/calc.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage1/models/calc.js) class is *super* simple. Tragically simple really. In fact, what is interesting here is that although we "knew" from specification in natural language that the calculator should have a concept of being cleared, in order to pass our tests we don't really have to do anything in the `clearCalculator` method. We'll discuss this and come back to it more in Stage 2 and 3.
### Second feature: Subtraction (aka Stage 2)
What goes up must come down, right? So the next stage sees us adding a feature specification for subtraction. As before, let's first update our code to this stage.
``` bash
  $ git checkout Stage2
  $ npm test
```
You should see something like:
``` bash
  .........
  
  3 scenarios (3 passed)
  9 steps (9 passed)
```
More tests defined and passing now.
#### Features
At this stage we define our new subtraction feature in the [`features/subtraction.feature`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage2/features/subtraction.feature) file. It is very similar to the addition feature previously discussed so not much more to discuss.
#### Step Definitions
The step definitions file, [`features/support/steps.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage2/features/support/steps.js), now includes [only] one more step. This is because the `Given` and the `Then` steps can be re-used from our previous work, so all we need is one new `When` handling the subtraction. 

**But**, this is where things start to get really interesting...

Now that we are considering more than just addition, we actually need to revisit the way these steps work. [Previously](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage1/features/support/steps.js) the `Then` step called the `this.add` method on the World directly. But now that we want to re-use this step from our subtraction scenario, it makes no sense at all to call `this.add` here. It was perfectly reasonable back in Stage 1 to do this, and if that's the only feature our system had, that would be all well and good. But it's not the only feature any more.

So what we need to do is request some `this.result` from the calculator in the `Then` step (regardless of whether we were adding or subtracting), and we pull back the `this.add` and `this.subtract` method calls into their respective `@When` steps.

This drives some interesting and appropriate change "downstream" throughout the rest of the system.

#### World
Our World - [`features/support/world.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage2/features/support/world.js) - just has one simple `this.subtract` method added.

However the downstream refactoring we mentioned above flows through the World as well. Now we don't need / want to return a value from the `this.add` and the new `this.subtract` methods. So we don't. And we also want to define some `this.result` method that requests the current result from the calculator (`this.calc.result()`).

At this point we're just "specifying" that this is what would make sense, to interact with the calculator in this way. We don't care at this stage how the actual calculator model must change to support this. [Outside-in](#bdd-and-cucumberjs-overview).
#### Calculator Model
The calculator model - [`models/calc.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage2/models/calc.js) - now has to be refactored as well, as we'd expect, to support our new specification.

Ultimately we've made the calculator a little more realistic. Instead of the `this.add` and `this.subtract` methods directly returning the value, they more appropriately just perform the addition or subtraction operation, and store the result in the new `_currentSum` property. Then the current result at any point in time can be requested with the `this.result` method.
#### Stage 2 Comments
What is interesting here is that by simply re-using one single step in the step definitions (the `Then` step) in both the addition and the subtraction features, this drives change all the way down the chain: from the step definitions to the World to our Calculator class. On the whole it results in us having a more realistic (real world) calculator - one which obviously now supports two features instead of one.
### Third feature: Chaining multiple operations (aka Stage 3)
So the last stage sees us adding a feature specification for multiple chained operations - that is the ability to add more than two consecutive numbers, subtract numbers, all in the same single operation (e.g. 3 + 6 + 25 - 15 + 77 - 154). As before, let's first update our code to this stage.
``` bash
  $ git checkout Stage3
  $ npm test
```
You should see something like:
``` bash
  // ... lot of yellow stdout ...

  9 scenarios (6 undefined, 3 passed)
  37 steps (17 undefined, 10 skipped, 10 passed)
```
Tests are broken :o


  **It's your turn to make them pass**


#### Features
Now we're really pumping out the features. The new feature is defined in [`features/multiple_operations.feature`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage3/features/multiple_operations.feature). We can see that we're adding many new scenarios where we chain more operations.

Worthy of mention here is the `And` steps. We haven't used these before, but they do what you'd expect, they allow us to add or chain more `When` events. They can also be used in `Given` and `Then` steps.

Apart from that, by now the feature definitions should be fairly self-explanatory.

#### Step Definitions
Our step definitions ([`features/support/steps.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage3/features/support/steps.js)) now undergo some more refinements. Because previously we were thinking about addition and subtraction as automic operations, it made sense to break them into a `this.setArguments` and `this.add` or `this.subtract` methods. e.g, we wanted to add "a" and "b" to get "c", so we called `this.setArguments(a,b)` and then called `this.add`.

But now things have changed, and we realise that if we consider adding and subtracting in the wider context of chained operations, then an add of "a" and "b" is really the same as adding "a" (onto our current sum, whatever that is) and then adding "b". Conversely, subtracting "a" from "b" is the same as adding "b" (onto our current sum, whatever that is) then subtracting "a".

Therefore for Addition, in [Stage2](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage2/features/support/steps.js) where we used to have:
``` javascript
  When('I add {int} and {int}', function (arg1, arg2) {
    this.setArguments(arg1, arg2);
    this.add()
    ...
```
in [Stage3](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage3/features/support/steps.js) we will have:
``` javascript
  When('I add {int} and {int}', function (arg1, arg2) {
    this.add(arg1)
    this.add(arg2)
    ...
```

Therefore for Subtraction, in [Stage2](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage2/features/support/steps.js) where we used to have:
```javascript
  When('I subtract {int} from {int}', function (arg1, arg2) {
    this.setArguments arg2, arg1
    this.substract()
    ...
```
in [Stage3](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage3/features/support/steps.js) we will have:
```javascript
  When('I subtract {int} from {int}', function (arg1, arg2) {
    this.add(arg2)
    this.substract(arg1)
    ...
```
The `this.add` and `this.subtract` methods have to be refactored to take a parameter of the number being added or subtracted, whereas they used to take no parameters and just caused the operation to execute (based on a previous `this.setArguments` call).

So that is the main change to existing code, and we also have to add methods for `When('then add {int}` and `When('then subtract {int}` which should be fairly obvious - just one argument now.

#### World
Our World object ([`features/support/world.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage3/features/support/world.js)) now gets a little simpler actually. We can get rid of the `this.setArguments` method - we need it no more. Then we just have to add the new parameters for `this.add` and `this.subtract`.
#### Calculator Model
These changes keep flowing through and actually the Calculator class ([`models/calc.js`](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage3/models/calc.js)) will become a little simpler (less code) but more sophisticated as well. Again we have to remove `setArguments`, this is no longer needed. We can then also remove the `_arg1` and `_arg2` class properties.

We again can refactor the `add` and `subtract` methods to take the number being added or subtracted as a parameter, and updating the `_currentSum`.
#### Stage 3 Comments
What is interesting in this final stage is that the final set of features, once again, cause us to re-think how the addition and subtraction work. We are left with a "working" calculator that is more sophisticated (real world), has less code, and supports more features. As we can see in the Stage3 [features file](https://github.com/js-republic/cucumber-slice-by-slice/blob/Stage3-Solution/features/multiple_operations.feature), we can start to specify all sorts of scenarios, including clearing the calculator mid-stream.

## Final Comments
One thing that makes it interesting (to me), and what I've tried to demonstrate here, is that we can see how the system being tested becomes more sophisticated as more features are added. I don't just mean that it becomes more complex, that more code is added, I mean that adding more feature specs forces (or at least strongly encourages) us to write a system that evolves quickly to approximate what we think the final system should look like.
